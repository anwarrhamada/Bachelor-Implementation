season is one of the most effective features for consumption of energy
Number of days where the air conditioner is used affects the consumption of energy for a building.
Number of months where the air conditioner is used affects the consumption of energy for a building.
meter and building_id can be used to predict the rate of consumption by an R2 score of 94%.
"meter,building_id, and day_of_month can be used to predict the rate of consumption by an R2 score of 94.2%.."
day_of_month only has a 50% effect on the rate of consumption.
"day_of_month,season,meter,building_id,and square_feet had the same effect on the rate of energy consumption."
"primary_use,day_of_month,day_of_week,season,meter,building_id,and square_feet are the most important features for consumption forecasting"
site_id and square_feet have decreased the rate of consumption prediction by 8%.
site_id and square feet are not useful for energy consumption.
square_feet hasn't contributed in the final prediction.
precip_depth_1_hasn't contributed in the final prediction
precip_depth_1_hr and square_feet reduce the accuracy of forecasting by 1%.
"primary_use,day_of_week,day_of_month,season,meter,building_id,square_feet gained more forecasting importance by forward feature selection."
wind_speed is detected as the main source of causing season change in the dataset.
meter is the best candidate for forecasting when it comes to the decision tree regressor.
Decision tree regressor and classifier are both used for feature selection.
"meter ,site_id, and building_age are the most important features for energy consumption of the building."
building_age is important for energy forecasting.
"Using building_age,the MSE for energy forecasting is 0.14."
"Using site_id,the MSE for energy forecasting is 3.99."
"Using site_id as main cause,the MSE for energy forecasting is 3.86."
"Using site_id as a second main cause,the MSE for energy forecasting is 3.80."
"Using building_age,the MSE for energy forecasting has improved ."
"Using building_age,the MSE for energy forecasting has improved by 50%."
Decision tree reggresor is used as a regression model
Random forest regressor is used as a regression model.
"building_id,month,and meter are most important faetures based on the light LGB model."
meter is the most important feature according to light LGB and decision tree regressor.
site_id is not important for energy consumption forecasting.
hours_of_usage is important for energy consumption forecasting.
24 features are used for energy consumption regression.
Logarithms of energy consumption are used for regresssion.
Forward feature selection is used for energy consumption.

primary_use is important.
day_of_week is important.
day_of_month is important.
meter is important.
building_id and square_feet are important features.
cloud_coverage and day_of_week are not important.
mean sea_level_pressure and wind_speed are negatively affecting the result of the regression.
weather_condition is important.
characteristics of the house are also important.
weather subclasses are more important than building subclasses.
day_of_month is also affecting the forecasting.
weather_condition is important for energy prediction.
weather is important.
weather and building_age are input features 
weather affects the features of the building's structure.
square_meter is the most important feature out of all building's features.
wind_speed affects the environment.
day_of_month is one of the season's features.
season and hours_of_day affect the consumption rate.
Energy consumption affects the working condition. 
day_of_month is an important feature.
building_age is important for feature extraction of energy consumption.
mean cloud_coverage and wind_speed are not important.
"day_of_month,dew_temperature,hour,season,month,meter,precip_depth_1_hr,building_id,site_id, and square_feet are input features."
"building_age,primary_use,is_weekend,wind_speed,cloud_coverage,day_of_week are input features."
"mean sea_level_pressure_wind_speed,wind_compass_direction,mean cloud_coverage,and sea_level_pressure are input features."
air_temperature is an important feature.
mean air_temperature and sea_level_pressure are important features for work
sea_level_pressure is an important feature for work
mean precip_depth_1_hr and sea_level_pressure are not important.
6 features are optimal for feature extraction.
10 features won't affect the accuracy of the work. 
24 features are not good for feature extraction.
Winter and summer are the two seasons that affect energy consumption the most.
temperature_of_electricity and daily_temperature are 10째C in winter and 22째C in summer respectively.
hot_climate is one of the key factors that influence the energy consumption
"Due to the economic development and the improvement of living standards, an increase in electricity consumption is needed"
The number of air conditioners per 100 households was 200 in urban and 147 in rural area in 2010
The seasonal variations of electricity demand and temperature are compared.
"In summer, the electricity consumption utterly increases due to the great demand on cooling."
"In winter, the electricity consumption decreases due the demand being mainly dependant on heating."
It is concluded that the base temperatures of electricity consumption reach 22째C in summer and are below 10째C in winter.
precip_depth_1_hr and square_feet reduce the accuracy of forecasting by 1.2%.
meter is the most important feature.
month is the most important feature.
day_of_month is the most important feature.
